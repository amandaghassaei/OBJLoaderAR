##Projection Mapping Alignment

<img ref="projectionAR.png"/>


A WebGL app that breaks out many of the <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">threejs</a> camera parameters to fine tune projection mapping alignment to a physical model.  Sends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code" target="_blank">G-code</a> to a rotary stage (via a node server) to rotate the physical and virtual models together.  I began to also incorporate some closed loop optimization into the alignment process via a webcam - though that work was never quite finished.  Part of a collaboration with <a href="http://www.jeffkoons.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Koons studio</a>.  Live demo <a href="http://git.amandaghassaei.com/ProjectionMappingAlignment/" target="_blank">here</a>.
